# Monopoly Deal
Repo for an online version of Hasbro's Monopoly Deal card game.
## Description
Over two weeks, I developed an online version of Hasbro's Monopoly Deal card game for friends to play during lockdown.

I used React to create a SPA that:
* communicated with an authoritative server, supporting up to five concurrent players,
* used SCSS for the entire UI (no images/SVGs were used),
* used Socket.IO to allow the server to respond to a variety of client actions.

## Technology
### Frontend
HTML, SCSS, JavaScript (with TypeScript and React)
### Backend
Node.js
## Credits
Thanks to Hasbro for publishing Monopoly Deal. I take no ownership of Hasbro, Monopoly or Monopoly Deal. Monopoly and Monopoly Deal are the intellectual property of Hasbro.
